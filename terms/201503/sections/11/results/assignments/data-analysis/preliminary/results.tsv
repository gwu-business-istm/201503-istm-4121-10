66	awesome dataset; good dataset context description; could benefit from a factual executive summary at the beginning; good correspondance between sql and analytical findings; perfectly repeatable and logical; be careful about your attribute selections when using a group by clause - grouped attributes should be selected and other attributes should be aggregated or excluded;
66	good executive summary; good organizationl good analytical context; good sql; could benefit from aggregate sql functions and clauses; not sure about the use of where clause in conjunction with limit clause for the purpose you mention; are you referencing <> when you mean LIKE?
