## Instructional Materials

All class documents and instructional materials are available online in a public
[GitHub](https://github.com/) repository.

> bookmark this: https://github.com/gwu-business/istm-4121

At any given time, documents in the repository may be
at different stages of ideation and completion.
The word `todo` signifies intention of updating a document.

If you see a typo, or would like to contribute to the materials, feel free to edit any of the documents
(requires a GitHub account; ask an instructor how to "commit").

For convenience, some instructional materials, like the Syllabus,
 will be posted to Blackboard as well.
 These documents will be versioned, and may be out-of-date at some times.

## Email

All members of the Learning Community have **GWU-issued email addresses**, which may be used for email communications. If emailing an instructor, include `ISTM-4121` in the subject.

## Assignment Submission

Most assignments will be submitted through [Blackboard](http://www.blackboard.com/), mostly for privacy reasons.
