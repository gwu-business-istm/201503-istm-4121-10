# Group Project

## Description

Students will work together in instructor-assigned teams of two, three, or four
 to design and implement
 a **relational database-backed information system**
 which fulfills the component assignment requirements.

### Component Assignments

The [Midterm Pitch](assignments/group-project/midterm-pitch.md) evaluates student ability to
 identify and analyze business problems,
 identify an information system solution,
 and describe system objectives.
 Systems with the demonstrated ability or possible potential to provide real-world impact are desirable.

The [Final Documentation](assignments/group-project/final-documentation.md) deliverable evaluates student ability to
 describe in detail
   system objectives,
   system design decisions,
   and system operation instructions.

The [Final Implementation](assignments/group-project/final-implementation.md) deliverable evaluates student ability to
 implement the system described in their final documentation. Full database functionality is expected. Full software application functionality is desirable, but partial software application functionality is acceptable. Students may leverage [a variety of toolsets](/resources/group-project/toolsets.md) to implement database and application functionality.

The [Final Presentation](assignments/group-project/final-presentation.md) evaluates student ability to
 communicate system design and demonstrate system implementation functionality.

## Submission Instructions

Refer to the submission instructions for each component assignment.

Each group should elect a representative who will be responsible for communicating progress and submitting assignments on behalf of all group members.

## Evaluation Methodology

Refer to the evaluation methodologies for each component assignment.

Each member of the group will receive the same grade for each group project assignment submission.

At the end of the semester, a group member evaluation form will give each student an opportunity to identify the relative contributions of each other group member. The result of these evaluations may influence individual grades on group project assignments.
