# Data Processing

Choose the right tool for the job.

Common tools are spreadsheets, databases, and scripts.

The data processing tool selection decision is a function of:

 + information inputs (source data)
 + information outputs
 + information update/refresh frequency
 + volume/size of source data
 + type/format of source data (e.g. CSV, JSON, and SQL, XML, etc.)
 + cost, scalability, productivity, accuracy, and performance
 + design considerations and hardware/software/network limitations
 + accuracy of processing
 + audience/user capabilities, preferences and skills
 + security, privacy, and sharing considerations
