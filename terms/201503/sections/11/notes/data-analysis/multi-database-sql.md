# Multi-database SQL

Sometimes tables in one database may have relationships with one or more tables in one or more other databases.

This is the case in a data warehouse, or collection of databases.

Refer to the [SQL Style Guide](/notes/data-analysis/sql-style-guide.md) for multi-database SQL considerations.
